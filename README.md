# About
Fullstack-monitor-CLI is log monitoring tools for developers, offering visibility of console logs, requests and responses from both the Client and Server side of your application in one single place.

This makes it easy to see what is happening across the stack as your front and back-end communicate.

In order to use this, you must also install the [Fullstack-Monitor](https://github.com/PFA-Pink-Fairy-Armadillo/fullstack-monitor) into the project you want to monitor.

- [Fullstack-Monitor NPM Package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fullstack-monitor)

- [Fullstack-Monitor-CLI NPM Package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fullstack-monitor-cli).

## Browser Interface

- This is what the browser interface looks like, when monitoring a fullstack application. You can see Client and Server logs, and requests and responses between the Client and the Server.
- You can use use the `--chrome` command to open this view in the Google Chrome browser, or navigate to `localhost:3861` in your browser of choice, the application is served by default, once you have started the server using `--start`.
